# HomomorphicEncryptionDemo
This code repository is to showcase Homomorphic Encryption using the Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS) Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) scheme. This demonstration showcases the power of privacy-preserving computations using the TenSEAL library, designed for seamless homomorphic encryption operations on tensors. Built on the robust foundation of Microsoft SEAL, TenSEAL offers a user-friendly interface for secure and efficient computation of encrypted data.

# About CKKS and TenSEAL
CKKS, an acronym derived from the last names of its inventors, namely Cheon, Kim, Kim, and Song, represents a breakthrough in homomorphic encryption. It enables computations on encrypted real numbers, facilitating secure data analysis and machine learning tasks.

TenSEAL leverages the capabilities of CKKS, offering a comprehensive library for homomorphic encryption operations on tensors. Its integration with Microsoft SEAL provides a reliable framework for conducting computations while maintaining data privacy and security.

# Scenario
Imagine yourself as an employee in a company during performance review season. Everyone anticipates salary increments and bonuses, but you're hesitant to share your salary details with the HR department. With homomorphic encryption, you can encrypt your salary using CKKS and securely share it with HR. The HR department can perform mathematical operations like multiplication (for percentage increments) and addition (for bonus additions) on your encrypted salary data, preserving your privacy while facilitating necessary computations.
